# image-search
The uploaded Python script, Image search engine psp (1).pynb, implements a search engine for retrieving similar images using multiple methods. Here's an overview of the code and project:

Project Overview: Intelligent Image Search Engine
Objective:
To build an image-based search system that retrieves visually similar images from a dataset using various data structures (KD-Tree, LSH, and Product Quantization).
Key Components Identified in the Script
Feature Extraction:

Uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model from TensorFlow/Keras as the backbone.
The model's classification head is removed, and the avg_pool layer is used for extracting meaningful image features.
Preprocessing:

Images are resized, normalized, and converted into feature vectors using the ResNet50 model.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the high-dimensional feature vectors to a smaller, manageable size.
Clustering:

K-Means clustering organizes data points into similar groups for faster searching and analysis.
Search Methods:

KD-Tree: Enables efficient nearest-neighbor searches in reduced-dimensional space.
Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH): Hashes similar feature vectors into the same buckets to speed up approximate nearest-neighbor searches.
Product Quantization (PQ): Further compresses feature vectors and enables scalable search in large datasets.
GUI Integration:

A simple GUI is included to allow users to select a query image without specifying a file path.
Visualization:

Matplotlib and OpenCV are used to display retrieved images and their similarity scores.
Benchmarking:

Measures and prints the processing time for each step, including feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and search.
